# ZeroNet ID Providers

ZeroNet has the concept of an Identity Provider, which consists of a zite that can provide user identification functionality across other zites. A zite can only be used as an ID provider on a zite if that zite has specified it in its [content.json](https://zeronet.io/docs/site_development/content_json/).

The most well-known ID provider is [ZeroID](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/), which features unique usernames at the cost of relying on a centralized service to prevent duplicate username registrations.
